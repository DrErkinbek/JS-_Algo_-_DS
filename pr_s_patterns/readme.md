## Some patterns
* Frequency Counter - this pattern uses objects
or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested
loops or O(N2) operations with arrays/strings


* Multiple Pointers - creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

* Sliding Window. This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes. 
* Divide and Conquer. This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.

#### Binary Search Tree is classic Data Structure and Algorythm topic.
### OBJECTIVES:
* Define what a tree is
- **Tree** is data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship.

### Tree terminology.

**Root** - is a top node in a tree.

**Child** - a node directly connected to another node when a moving away from the root.

**Parent** - the converse notion of child.

**Siblings** - a group of nodes with the same parent. 

**Leaf** - a node with no children.

**Edge** - the connection between one node and another.


* Compare and contrast trees and lists.
**Lists** - linear.
**Trees** - nonlinear.

### Trees on different applications.
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstrack syntax tree
- Artificial intelligence
- Folders in operating system
- Computer file systems.

### Explain differences between trees, binary trees and binary search tree.
### How binary search tree works?
Every parent node has at most **two** children.
Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent.
Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent.

### Objectives

* Define what an algorithm is
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
* Devise a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

### Problem solving
* Understand the Problem
    1. Can I restate the problem in my own word?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are outputs that should come from the solution?
    4. Do I have enough information to solve the problem?

* Explore Concrete Examples
* Break it Down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor
    1. Can you check the result?
    2. Can you derive the result differently?
    3. Can you understand it at a glance?
    4. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    5. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
